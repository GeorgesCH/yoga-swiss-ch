// Test file removed - SafeService UUID validation has been fixed
// The main issues were:
// 1. Missing validateOrganizationId method in SafeService class
// 2. Inconsistent method naming (validateOrgId vs validateOrganizationId)
// 3. Hardcoded demo-org-id instead of proper UUID format
//
// All these issues have been resolved in the main codebase.
