## Current Configuration

- **Supabase URL**: `https://okvreiyhuxjosgauqaqq.supabase.co`
- **Project ID**: `okvreiyhuxjosgauqaqq`
- **Environment**: Production only
- **Local Development**: Not supported

## Benefits of Production-Only Setup

1. **Consistency**: All environments use the same database
2. **Security**: No risk of exposing local development data
3. **Deployment**: Simplified deployment process
4. **Maintenance**: Single source of truth for database structure
5. **Team Collaboration**: Everyone works with the same data

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Use production database for all operations
2. Create test data in production (use separate test organizations)
3. Use Supabase Studio for database exploration
4. Run `npm run verify-production` to verify configuration

### For Database Changes
1. Use Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Use Edge Functions for server-side operations
3. Apply migration scripts to production
4. Test changes in production environment

## Security Notes

- ✅ Only anon keys used in client-side code
- ✅ Service role keys restricted to Edge Functions
- ✅ All database access controlled through RLS policies
- ✅ No local development data exposure risk

## Verification

Run the verification script to ensure everything is properly configured:

```bash
npm run verify-production
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Check that production Supabase instance is running
   - Ensure your IP is not blocked by Supabase

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify anon key has correct permissions
   - Check RLS policies in production
   - Ensure user accounts exist in production

3. **Configuration Issues**
   - Run `npm run verify-production` to check setup
   - Verify `.env` file contains production URLs
   - Check that no localhost references exist

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with production database
2. Verify all features work correctly
3. Update team documentation
4. Remove any remaining local development references
5. Consider setting up staging environment if needed
