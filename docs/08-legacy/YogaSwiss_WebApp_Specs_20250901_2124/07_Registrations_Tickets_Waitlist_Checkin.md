# Registrations, Tickets, Waitlist & Check-in

Self-service management of upcoming and past bookings.

---

## 1) Pages
- `/account/bookings`: tabs **Upcoming**, **Past**, **Waitlist**.
- Row shows date/time, teacher, location, status, actions.
- Detail modal: ticket QR, add to calendar, share, transfer (if allowed), cancel/reschedule, notes.

---

## 2) Actions
- **Reschedule** within policy; **Cancel** with fee display; **Transfer** to friend (enter email) if enabled.
- **Join/Leave waitlist**; select **notification channels** for promo.
- **Check-in** QR for front desk scan; auto-check-in on livestream join (if configured).

---

## 3) Edge Cases
- Late cancellation vs no-show penalties; membership exemptions.
- Series bookings: manage entire series vs single occurrence.

---

## 4) Acceptance Criteria
- All changes logged; capacity updates propagate; refunds/fees computed consistently.
