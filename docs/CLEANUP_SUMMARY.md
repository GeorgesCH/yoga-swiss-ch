## ✅ Benefits of New Structure

1. **Easy Navigation**: Clear folder hierarchy with numbered prefixes
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related specifications grouped together
3. **Maintainability**: New specs can be added to appropriate folders
4. **Legacy Preservation**: Old content preserved but separated
5. **Quick Reference**: INDEX.md provides fast topic-based navigation
6. **Clean Root**: Root folder now contains only essential navigation files

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review the new structure** using README.md and INDEX.md
2. **Add new specifications** to appropriate numbered folders
3. **Update legacy content** as needed and move to active folders
4. **Maintain consistency** by following the established naming conventions

## 📋 Maintenance Guidelines

- **New specs**: Add to appropriate numbered folder
- **Updates**: Keep in same folder, update version numbers
- **Legacy content**: Move to 08-legacy/ when superseded
- **ZIP files**: Extract and organize content, then remove ZIP
- **System files**: Never commit .DS_Store or similar system files
